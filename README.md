Emporium_quote

1) What is wrong with the component you chose?
To me was too plain
2) How will you improve it?
Added some animations to it and adjusted some ui features
3) Given more time what would you further improve?
Could be more interactions or better design throughout


(I had issues with my VSCode connecting to Github, so I had to upload from PC- also could not commit because of this reason.
Hope it will not be a big issue in the task review. Thank you!)
